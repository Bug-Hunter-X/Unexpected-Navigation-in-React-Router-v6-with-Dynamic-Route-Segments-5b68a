In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment using `useNavigate` or `<Link>` can lead to unexpected behavior if the dynamic segment value is not properly handled.  For example, if the dynamic segment is optional or might contain characters that need to be escaped, an incorrect route path might be generated, resulting in a 404 error or incorrect page rendering.  This is particularly subtle because the issue often only manifests under certain input conditions.
